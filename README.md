üé§ Voice-Controlled LCD Display using Arduino
This project demonstrates a simple voice-controlled system using Arduino UNO, a Bluetooth module, and a 16x2 LCD display. It receives voice commands via Bluetooth and displays the message on the LCD in real time.

üõ†Ô∏è Components Used
Arduino UNO

16x2 LCD Display

HC-05/HC-06 Bluetooth Module

Jumper wires

Breadboard

Android smartphone with a Bluetooth terminal app (for voice-to-text)

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
Voice commands are spoken into a mobile app.

The app converts voice to text and sends it via Bluetooth.

Arduino receives the text using SoftwareSerial.

The command is displayed on the LCD and printed to the serial monitor.

üîå Circuit Connections
Component	Arduino Pin
LCD RS	8
LCD EN	9
LCD D4	10
LCD D5	11
LCD D6	12
LCD D7	13
Bluetooth TX	Pin 6 (RX)
Bluetooth RX	Pin 7 (TX)

‚ö†Ô∏è Use a voltage divider for Bluetooth RX pin to avoid 5V damage.

üßæ Code Overview
Uses LiquidCrystal for LCD display control.

Uses SoftwareSerial for Bluetooth communication.

Displays a fixed "Command:" label and prints the received command below it.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Getting Started
Upload the code to the Arduino board using Arduino IDE.

Connect the components as per the circuit table.

Pair your phone with the Bluetooth module (default PIN: 1234 or 0000).

Use a voice-to-text Bluetooth terminal app to send commands.

Watch them appear on the LCD screen.

üöÄ Further Development Ideas
Add support for multiple languages or character sets.

Integrate with motors or relays to act on specific voice commands.

Add memory to display command history or logs.

Use a speech recognition module directly (e.g., Elechouse Voice Recognition Module).

Extend functionality to IoT by adding Wi-Fi support via ESP8266 or ESP32.

Include keyword filtering or command validation.
